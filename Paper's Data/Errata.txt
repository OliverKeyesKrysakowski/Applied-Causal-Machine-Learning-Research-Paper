The following results were typographical/transliteration errors in the tables.  None of them have any impacton the conclusions drawn.In Table 1, the summary statistics for business profits were somewhat overstated at a mean of 16,500 and a standard deviation of 148,600.  They should read 14,900 and 147,400, respectively.In Table 8, row 2 (Baseline IV Regression: Only Villages With 50-200 Households), the insignificant estimate on the probability of business investment read -0.007 in the paper.  It should read 0.007.One other clarification: throughout the tables values in Thai baht have been rounded to the nearest 100, except for the case in which rounding would make the coefficient zero. In these cases, the coefficients (all statistically insignificant) have been rounded to the nearest 10 in order to show the reader the sign of the values.
