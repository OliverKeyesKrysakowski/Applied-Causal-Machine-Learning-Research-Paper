The Term Paper will build on the Research Paper (Research Paper.pdf) and utilize its data (found in the Paper's Data folder). 

Portions of the Python code, including data cleaning, data preparation, and segments of the regression analysis, have been adapted from the Stata code provided in Kaboski and Townsend's paper:

Kaboski, Joseph P., and Robert M. Townsend. "The Impact of Credit on Village Economies." *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics* 4, no. 2 (2012): 98â€“133. https://doi.org/10.1257/app.4.2.98.
